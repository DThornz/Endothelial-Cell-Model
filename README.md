# Endothelial Cell Model


Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) modulate smooth muscle cells (SMC) contractility, assisting in vascular tone and regulation. Our lab has created a detailed model for this cell that integrates plasma membrane electrophysiology and calcium dynamics to investigate EC responses to various stimuli. It also expands on previous formulations by including more detailed transmembrane current descriptions.

To assist in disseminating our model to as many people working in our field as possible we have designed an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows for a user to investigate various phenomena relating to EC behavior without having to understand the complicated coding or math formulations behind them.
